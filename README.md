# AutoZplotter
AutoZplotter is an autozygosity/homozygosity mapper, which takes a VCF file as input and allows for quick visualisation and manual identification of regions that have longer stretches of homozygosity (LRoH) than would be expected by chance

Usage (in a Unix environment): python autozplotter.py
